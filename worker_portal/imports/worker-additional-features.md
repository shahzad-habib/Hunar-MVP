# HUNAR � Worker Additional Features: UI Requirements

**Document Purpose:** Frontend/UI specification for Google Stitch  
**Scope:** Four additional Worker-side sections � Dispute, Review & Rating, Category, and Location  
**Source of Truth:** `prompt.md`, `design-prompt.md`, `colors.md`, `design.md`, `worker-workflow-mvp.md`

> **Important for Stitch:** Do not create a new design system. Apply the existing HUNAR design system defined in `design.md` and `colors.md` exactly. All colors, typography, spacing, button styles, card styles, and component patterns referenced in this document come directly from those files.

---

## Design System Reference (Summary)

All UI in this document must follow these rules already defined in the HUNAR project:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Primary (Teal) | `#0F766E` | Primary CTAs, active states, verified badge, links |
| Primary Dark | `#115E59` | Hover state on primary buttons |
| Primary Light | `#0F766E15` | Active pill toggles, badge highlights |
| Navy | `#1A1A2E` | Headings, numbers, prices, body text |
| Gray | `#64748B` | Secondary text, metadata, timestamps |
| Background | `#F8FAFC` | Page canvas |

| Error | `#DC2626` | Cancelled, Rejected, Dispute, Delete |

**Typography:** Inter font, weights 400�700. Headings use Semi-Bold with tight letter-spacing. Labels/metadata use uppercase with expanded tracking (`label-sm` style). See `design.md` for full type scale.

**Status Badges:** Pill radius (`9999px`), `label-sm` uppercase. Colors match semantic token table above.

## Section 1 � Dispute

### Overview

A dispute is raised when a job ends in an unresolved disagreement between the worker and the customer. This can happen when:

- The customer believes the work was not completed properly.
- The worker believes the customer refuses to pay for legitimate completed work.
- There is a disagreement over scope, pricing, or quality.

The Dispute section appears in the Worker's sidebar navigation under **"My Jobs"** or as a sub-section under an active/completed job detail screen.

---

### 1.1 Entry Point � When a Dispute Can Be Raised

A dispute can be raised from the **Job Details screen** once the job has reached one of these statuses:

- `repair_approved`
- `in_progress`
- `completed` (before payment is confirmed)
- `payment_disputed`

A **"Raise Dispute"** ghost/text button appears at the bottom of the job detail screen � styled as a Secondary button with an Error (`#DC2626`) text color and border. It must never be the primary CTA on that screen.

**Button label:** `Raise a Dispute`  
**Position:** Below all primary job actions, separated by a hairline divider (`1px solid #E2E8F0`).

---

### 1.2 Raise Dispute � Modal / Sheet

When the worker taps "Raise a Dispute", display a **bottom sheet or modal overlay** (not a new page).

**Modal structure:**

- **Title:** `Raise a Dispute` (headline-sm, `#1A1A2E`)
- **Subtitle:** `Describe the issue clearly. Admin will review the case and contact both parties.` (body-sm, `#64748B`)
- **Divider** (`1px solid #E2E8F0`)

**Form fields inside the modal:**

1. **Dispute Reason** � Dropdown / Select  
   Label: `Reason for Dispute`  
   Options:
   - Customer refusing to pay
   - Customer made false claims
   - Scope of work disagreement
   - Quality dispute raised by customer
   - Other

2. **Description** � Textarea  
   Label: `Describe the issue`  
   Placeholder: `Provide a clear description of the problem...`  
   Character limit: 500 characters  
   Show live character count (e.g., `0 / 500`) in `label-sm`, `#64748B`

3. **Supporting Evidence** � Optional file upload  
   Label: `Attach Photos or Documents (Optional)`  
   Sub-label: `Max 5 files. Supports JPG, PNG, PDF.`  
   Upload area: dashed border (`1px dashed #E2E8F0`), centered icon + text  
   After upload: show thumbnail grid with individual remove buttons

**Actions:**
- Primary CTA: `Submit Dispute` � Teal button, full-width inside modal
- Secondary: `Cancel` � Ghost/text button, centered below primary

**Submission behavior:** Show an inline loading state on the button. On success, close modal and show a **toast notification**: `"Your dispute has been submitted. Admin will review within 24 hours."` (Success toast � green `#16A34A` left border).

---

### 1.3 Active Dispute � Status Banner on Job Card

Once a dispute is submitted, the job card in **"My Jobs"** must display a status banner:

- Background: light red (`#DC262615`)
- Left border accent: `3px solid #DC2626`
- Icon: warning or shield-alert icon in `#DC2626`
- Label: `Dispute Under Review` � `label-sm`, uppercase, `#DC2626`

The job status badge updates to: **`Disputed`** � pill badge, red tint background, red text.

---

### 1.4 Dispute Detail Screen

When the worker taps on a disputed job to view its details, display a dedicated **Dispute Status Section** within the existing job detail screen (not a separate page).

**Section header:** `Dispute Status` (headline-sm)  
**Visual treatment:** White card with `1px solid #E2E8F0` border, `0.5rem` radius, `1.5rem` padding

**Resolved State:** When the dispute is resolved, the banner changes:
- If worker-favored: Green banner (`#16A34A`), label: `Dispute Resolved � Payment Released`
- If customer-favored: Orange banner (`#F59E0B`), label: `Dispute Resolved � See Admin Decision`

---

### 1.5 Disputes List � "My Disputes" Sub-Section

- Right: Status badge pill

**Empty state:**

1. Receiving a review from a customer (read-only)

This section appears in:
1. **Onboarding Step:** "Select Skills & Categories" (during registration)

Do NOT give each category its own color."*

**Selection behavior:**
- Multiple selections allowed (worker can serve multiple categories)

**Layout:** Same category grid as onboarding, with currently-selected categories pre-filled in their selected state.

**Save action:** `Save Changes` � Primary Teal button  
**Confirmation:** Toast notification: `"Your service categories have been updated."` (Success, green)

**Layout:** Same components as onboarding (search field + map + radius selector + multiple areas).

**Save action:** `Save Location` � Primary Teal button  
**Confirmation:** Toast: `"Your service area has been updated."` (Success, green)

| Section | Navigation Location |
|---|---|
| **Dispute** | Worker sidebar ? My Jobs ? (Disputes tab on job detail) |
| **Review & Rating** | Worker sidebar ? Reviews (already listed in nav) |
| **Category** | Worker sidebar ? Profile ? My Services |
| **Location** | Worker sidebar ? Profile ? My Location |

The sidebar navigation items **Profile** and **Reviews** already exist per the HUNAR spec. **Dispute** and the Category/Location sub-sections are accessible from within existing screens � no new top-level nav items are required.

---

## Shared UI Behaviors

These behaviors apply across all four sections and are consistent with the existing HUNAR design system:

- **Loading states:** Primary buttons show a spinner inside them during async operations. Do not disable unrelated UI during loading.
- **Toast notifications:** All success and error messages use toast notifications appearing at the top-right of the screen (desktop) or top-center (mobile). Duration: 4 seconds. Success = green left border, Error = red left border.
- **Modals / Bottom Sheets:** All secondary actions (dispute form, review form, confirm dialogs) use modals on desktop and bottom sheets on mobile. Overlay backdrop: `rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.4)`.
- **Empty States:** Never leave a section blank. Each section above defines its own empty state copy consistent with `prompt.md` Section 28.
- **Responsive:** All screens follow the 12-column desktop grid (max `1200px`) collapsing to single-column mobile layout with `16px` lateral padding, as defined in `design.md`.
